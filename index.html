    <h1><em>Aite, Ima Start Selling Drugs</em></h1>
    <h2><em>A short story based on a man who struggles to survive in California</em></h2>
</header>

<article>
<h2>INTRODUCTION <br></h2>
  <p>Life in California has become a luxury. No longer home to the natives, the cost of living has skyrocketed due to the massive surge of colonization. Anybody could lose here. Anybody could win.</p>
    

    <h2>PART 1. The Child <br></h2>
      <p> Born during the era of freedom and creativity, never did he leave. A child with a fire inside, surrounded by water. Silenced and upset. Motivated but confused.</p>
    

<h2>PART 2. The Water That Surrounds The Fire </h2>
<p>A fire only knows how to burn, and then go out. Water only knows how to be water, silent and still, unless moved by another force. Together they create chaos in each other's world, but there is also something harmonizing about it all.  A dance between the two is what defines man today. 

 The water doesn’t want the fire to burn, the fire doesn’t want the water to touch it. A sad love story that has lasted for centuries. 

Inevitably, the chaos ensues and the steam clears. What’s left? A story, a foundation, and potential. </p>


<h2>PART 3. Missed Opportunities<br></h2>
   <p> An opportunity is a window of time, filled with a blessing. It comes as subtle as a wave in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Sometimes we catch these waves, and sometimes they go over our heads - leaving us underwater. These are the moments he learns to swim, by himself.</p>
    
    
<h2>PART 4. The Mirror<br></h2>

    <p>When things get quiet, there is only reflection. In search of validation, contentment, a friend, and advice - all he has is his reflection. His reflection though…does not care to look at itself. </p>
